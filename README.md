I created the design screen of my form using labels and buttons of the calculator. I customized the coloring and font design according to my taste. Later, I assigned actions to my buttons, and in the background, I used an if statement block to display "one" on the screen if the count is equal to zero, for example, when the "one" button is pressed. I used this for all my buttons. If there is a space on the screen, I commanded it to be cleared in the false way. For my equal button, I used switch cases. This way, depending on the entered sign by the user, the corresponding case will execute, and it will stop with the break command. We had taken the first number from the user, and we also took the second number on the equal screen.
